# LIRIbot
Hello and welcome to LIRIbot. LIRIbot is an application I built to search for movies, music, and concerts.

Here is a video of me demonstrating how to use the app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4TjObw1GKCKFEG6CoHcKuEM-fdg6_94/view

I, Max Bloom, created LIRIbot using the OMDb, Spotify, and Bands in Town APIs. I also used axios and node to get my app working.

To search movies, type "node liri.js movie-this" followed by the movie you want to search in your terminal. 

To search music, type "node liri.js spotify-this-song" followed by the song you want to search in your terminal. 

To search concerts, type "node liri.js concert-this" followed by the band you want to search in your terminal.

To have it read the text file, enter what type of search you want to conduct (movie-this, spotify-this-song, concert-this), followed by your search query. Make sure to save the random.txt document before you continue. Then type "node liri.js read-what-it-says" in your terminal.
